Welcome to the NLP for Social Sciences User Guide Github repository! You’ll find the fully rendered version of the guide [here](https://ccss-rs.github.io/nlp-for-socsci/index.html).

If you’d like to follow along with the guide on your local computer, there’s three files within this repository you’ll want to download. “nyc_reddit_data.csv” is the guide’s baseline data set file, “nyc_sentiment.csv” is the equivalent file after having conducted sentiment analysis within the code demo of Chapter 3, and “nyc_STM.RData” is a downloadable R file that features the finalized topic models within Chapter 4’s demo. 

There’s two options for accessing these files. First, you can download all of the files associated with this repository through the green “Code” drop down near the top of the page either as a downloadable ZIP file or through Github Desktop. Second, you can individually download each of the files by clicking on their respective names above, clicking the “Download” option, and for the CSV files then right-clicking to “Save As” to your computer.

If you have any questions feel free to connect with me directly at rps256@cornell.edu.
